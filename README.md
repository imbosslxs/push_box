# Push Box 1.0.0

It's a windows console game without graphics but char.
However,it may be funny i think.

Note that,it has used a lib which provides the function about windows console and which was written by me as well XD.
Although it's not very high-tech but that's all I can do(I don't even know what I'm saying).

So,enjoy it or improve it whatever you like (or dislike...)
